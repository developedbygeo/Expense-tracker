# Expense Tracker

<img src='./public/sample.jpg' width='400px'>

My first **React** project! A simple, fully-responsive, expense tracker that allows expense input and outputs a concise overview of the spending on a monthly basis. It was created as part of practising with React, while pursuing the **React** section of The Odin Project.

## Installation

**Install** the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Launch the **test runner** in the interactive watch mode:

```
npm test
```

**Remove** the single build dependency from the project:

```
npm run eject
```

## Features

- Filtering on a yearly basis.
- Live cost-aggregation display.

## Tech
